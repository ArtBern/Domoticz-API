# Python Domoticz API <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Alfa-orange.svg" />

The goal of this project is to have access to other devices, user variables, send notifications, etc. in Domoticz Python plugins.
This API uses the interfaces as defined at https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL%27s

## This is an alpha version

Therefore this api is not fully tested, or contains incorrect or incomplete documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Xorfor/Domoticz-API/wiki), etc.
Please look at the 'test_'-examples how to use this api. The 'plugin.py' contains an implementation of this api.
