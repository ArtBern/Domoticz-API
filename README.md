# Python Domoticz API

The goal of this project is to have access to other devices, user variables, send notifications, etc. in Domoticz Python plugins.
This API uses the interfaces as defined at https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL%27s

## This is an alpha version
[Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Alfa-orange.svg)

Therefore this api is not fully tested, or contains incorrect documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Xorfor/Domoticz-API/wiki), etc.
